    win32com decides method-vs-property from the type library, and for a number of

    raises `DISP_E_MEMBERNOTFOUND` (0x80020003), which reads exactly like "this API does
    not exist". It does exist. Calling the same DISPID with DISPATCH_METHOD works.

    Confirmed cases (each cost hours before being found):
      * `ModelDoc2.InsertGtol`      — geometric tolerance "impossible" for two days
      * `INote.GetAnnotation`       — notes could not be positioned
      * `IFeature.FirstFeature` / `GetNextFeature` / `GetDefinition` — feature walk

    So: for any of those (and anything that reports MEMBERNOTFOUND on a method that the
    documentation says exists) use this instead of attribute access. `static_check.py`
    fails the build when a known trap is called directly.

    P0-1 (0.8.22): bounded retry, and the two failure classes are handled differently.
    A busy SolidWorks answers "Call was rejected by callee"; sleeping 0.25 s then 0.5 s and
    asking again succeeds (observed while a rebuild was running). A dead link is NOT
    retried — the dispatcher is worthless — so the cache is dropped and `BridgeLost` is
    raised with a message that says the next call will reconnect.

    Note on timeouts: this is not a thread-level watchdog. pywin32 dispatches on the STA
    thread that owns the object, so running the call on a worker thread and abandoning it
    after N seconds risks corrupting the COM apartment rather than cancelling anything. The
    bounded retry plus the liveness probe in get_sw() cover the reported failure mode (a
    bus/link failure that never recovers); a single genuinely hung call still blocks, which
    is a SolidWorks-side condition no client can safely interrupt.
