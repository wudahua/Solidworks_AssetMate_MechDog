"""Body-level appearance for multibody parts.

Measured on SW 2024 SP4 (2026-10-26):
- IBody2.MaterialPropertyValues is writable but silently ineffective, and reads back None.
- Extension.SetMaterialPropertyValues + SelectByID2('name','SOLIDBODY') works for SOME
  bodies only (small bodies yes, the main 758-face shell no) — unusable as a guarantee.
- IFace2.MaterialPropertyValues works for every face, reads back correctly, and costs
  ~12 s for 758 faces. This module therefore paints per BODY by iterating its faces.

Trade-off: face-level appearance overrides any existing face appearance, so operate on a
copy. There is no reliable per-body single-call API; pretending otherwise is worse.
