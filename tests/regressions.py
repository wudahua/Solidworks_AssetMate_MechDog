"""Regression ledger — every bug that shipped gets a permanent assertion.

Why this file exists
--------------------
Between 0.8.0 and 0.8.15 this project fixed roughly fifteen real bugs, and almost none of
them were guarded by a test. Each one was found by a reviewer, fixed, released, and then
left to be re-broken by the next refactor. The duplicate-`def` incident proved the point:
the same file had already lost 40 minutes to shadowing, and it happened again two hours
later in the same file.

So: one entry per fixed bug. Each entry carries a **static** check (runs anywhere, no
SolidWorks) and, where it makes sense, a **live** check (needs SolidWorks, called from
smoke.py). A bug that cannot be asserted is a bug that will come back.

Run the static half:

    python tests/regressions.py

Exit code 0 = every static assertion passed.
